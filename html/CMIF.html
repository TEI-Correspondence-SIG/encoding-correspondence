                        <h2>Objectives and principles</h2>
                        
                        <p id="1"><span class="paragraph-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span>The Correspondence Metadata Interchange Format (CMIF) was developed for
                           editors of digital and printed scholarly editions to provide the most important
                           metadata about edited letters online and in a machine-readable form. This allows
                           for research, linking and analysis of correspondence across projects and
                           editions.</p>
                        
                        <p id="2"><span class="paragraph-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;2</span>On the basis of CMIF, researchers are able to search for letters from or to
                           specific persons, places or within specific timespans across separate edition
                           projects, which makes new comprehensive searches possible. For example, it makes
                           it easier to search for letters by senders or recipients who do not have their
                           correspondence covered in an individual letter edition. It is also possible to
                           search for letters from a certain period, if necessary in connection with a
                           certain place of dispatch or reception. With the implementation of version 2 one
                           should be able to mark the entities mentioned in the letter (persons, places,
                           publications, events etc.). As a result, it will be possible for the first time
                           to use large collections of letters to answer systematic research questions such
                           as how the music business was organized in the 19th century or how a certain
                           event was received by contemporaries.</p>
                        
                        <p id="3"><span class="paragraph-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span>The CMIF - as a dedicated exchange format - covers exclusively metadata and
                           these only in a focused form. It does not include full text data, not least to
                           avoid legal problems. For the same reason, it can be distributed under a free
                           license. It cannot be seen as a replacement for a complete and detailed
                           teiHeader, which is specifically defined and used for individual editorial
                           projects. The CMIF file is provided as an addition to a scholarly edition and is
                           independent from the technologies and formats used for a given digital edition.
                           Therefore, for the provision of the CMIF data, it does not matter whether the
                           digital edition itself is based on XML, a relational database, or a graph
                           database. After all, CMIF can also be used to provide the metadata of edited
                           letters within a printed edition.</p>
                        
                        <p id="4"><span class="paragraph-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;4</span>CMIF is intended exclusively for the exchange of relevant metadata beyond
                           project boundaries. It includes only those metadata that appear useful for
                           cross-project research, cross-linking and analysis. Put simply, the idea behind
                           CMIF is that information found in the index of letters, person, places etc. of
                           printed scholarly editions of correspondence can be provided digitally and in
                           machine-readable form.</p>
                        
                        <p id="5"><span class="paragraph-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span>The CMIF should enable fully automated exchange of data without needing
                           human intervention. To ensure this, the format must be restrictive and clearly
                           defined. Accordingly, when developing the format, the guiding principle was
                           "Keep it simple". By concentrating on essential metadata, the effort to provide
                           a CMIF file should also be kept as small as possible. In addition, an online
                           tool, the CMIF Creator, and detailed documentation are available.</p>

                        <p id="6"><span class="paragraph-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;6</span>CMIF is based on the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and
                           was developed within the <a href="https://tei-c.org/activities/sig/correspondence/" target="_blank">TEI Correspondence
                              Special Interest Group (SIG)</a>. The initiative for the format was
                           started in 2014 in the workshop "Briefeditionen um 1800: Schnittstellen finden
                           und vernetzen", which was organized by Anne Baillot and Markus Schnöpf at the
                           Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Shortly before, a task
                           force of the TEI Correspondence SIG (namely Marcel Illetschko, Sabine Seifert
                           and Peter Stadler) had started to develop a new concept for encoding
                           correspondence metadata for the TEI guidelines - realized in the new element
                           &lt;correspDesc&gt; (Correspondence Description). It is supposed to encode the
                           most important communication-specific "header data" of a letter in TEI-XML in a
                           standardized way, in particular sender, recipient, place of writing and date.
                           The proposal for correspDesc was accepted by the TEI Council, revised and
                           incorporated into the TEI guidelines in April 2015. (Stadler, Illetschko, and
                           Seifert 2016; TEI Consortium 2019).</p>
                        
                        <p id="7"><span class="paragraph-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;7</span>Already during the development of correspDesc, Peter Stadler outlined the
                           idea of developing a format for the exchange of correspondence metadata across
                           editions based on this new element. The element correspDesc should be used in a
                           significantly reduced and restrictive way to ensure an automated exchange of
                           data. A first draft of CMIF was developed following the workshop mentioned
                           above. Since then, CMIF has been developed and maintained within the framework
                           of the TEI Correspondence SIG. The schema definition using ODD and examples can
                           be found in the <a href="https://github.com/TEI-Correspondence-SIG/CMIF" target="_blank">GitHub repository of the SIG</a>.</p>
                        
                        <p id="8"><span class="paragraph-number">&nbsp;&nbsp;8</span>The TELOTA working group of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and
                           Humanities developed the web service <a href="https://correspsearch.net/" target="_blank">correspSearch</a> in order to "fill CMIF with life", i.e. to demonstrate
                           the possible application scenarios. It aggregates CMIF files available online
                           and offers the metadata for convenient research or automatic retrieval via an
                           API. The web service currently aggregates (as of 1.10.2019) 110 CMIF files with
                           metadata to almost 54,000 edited letters in 178 publications. (Dumont 2016)</p>

                           and Humanities in October 2018, version 2 of the CMIF was developed based on the

                        <p id="11"><span class="paragraph-number">11</span>The formulated principle also has implications for a decision between two
                           variants for encoding. With regard to CMIF, two possible encoding variants exist
                           within the framework of the TEI guidelines:</p>
                        
                        <p id="12"><span class="paragraph-number">12</span>On the one hand, it is possible to create one (albeit reduced) teiHeader
                           per letter and to use its capabilities (profileDesc, msDesc, keywords etc.) to
                           cover all necessary information. For an index of letters which includes the most
                           important metadata, several teiHeaders could then - to put it simply - be
                           combined in the element teiCorpus. Meta information on the letter index itself
                           could then be stored in the teiHeader of the teiCorpus element itself.</p>
                        
                        <p id="13"><span class="paragraph-number">13</span>On the other hand, it is possible to create one single TEI document and
                           provide one correspDesc element per letter there. With this variant, meta
                           information on the CMIF file is directly indicated in the document's
                           teiHeader.</p>
                        
                        <p id="14"><span class="paragraph-number">14</span>For the first version of CMIF, the second variant was chosen because it

                           elements) was completely sufficient for the desired metadata. In CMIF v1, only
                           the sender, the recipient, places of writing and receiving, date and the URL or
                           number of the letter are specified. This is what the TEI element correspDesc was
                           and is designed for. All other information - which is very manageable in terms
                           of numbers - can easily be placed in the teiHeader.</p>
                        
                        <p id="15"><span class="paragraph-number">15</span>With the further development of CMIF to version 2, however, further
                           metadata - such as persons mentioned in a letter - for which the correspDesc
                           element is not intended per se can now be noted. In this context it was
                           discussed again whether one should not use the entire teiHeader per letter. At
                           first glance, this seems to be a clean solution, but one creates a large
                           "overhead" of TEI-XML encoding, which one would like to avoid for the reasons
                           already mentioned - "keep it simple". In addition, such a teiHeader would still
                           be greatly reduced compared to the teiHeader in the digital edition itself, but
                           would at the same time suggest completeness. In addition, with the second
                           encoding variant - i.e. the exclusive use of correspDesc - the CMIF can be
                           further developed to be downward compatible. All further considerations are now
                           based on the premise that the previously chosen encoding variant, which is
                           essentially based on the use of correspDesc, will be retained.</p>
                        
                        <p id="16"><span class="paragraph-number">16</span>Here the fundamental question follows to what extent the CMIF should be
                           conform to the TEI guidelines. So far, no major problems occured with the use of
                           the TEI, which was essentially limited to the element correspDesc. But now - as
                           already discussed (Dumont 2015) - various further aspects have to be integrated
                           in correspDesc, which initially do not have their original location there. For
                           certain purposes, new attributes of their own would appear desirable, but they
                           would only be valid in CMIF and not generally in the TEI guidelines. Taking into
                           account the fact that the CMIF is rooted in the TEI community and the acceptance
                           based on it, the working group decided to focus on TEI conformity in the further
                           development of the format. According to the definitions of the TEI guidelines,
                           this includes, on the one hand, that the CMIF is validated against TEI All and,
                           on the other hand, that the TEI Abstract Model is implemented correctly. A
                           possible solution must take this into account.</p>

                        <p id="17"><span class="paragraph-number">17</span>Following these preliminary considerations, the question arises as to
                           which information should be included in the CMIF in addition to the information
                           already available in version 1. Hereof it is necessary to take the objectives of
                           the format postulated at the beginning into account: CMIF should enable both,
                           cross-project searches for letters and automated analysis of metadata, for
                           example for network research. The CMIF should not, as already mentioned, contain
                           the full range of metadata that is generated within a letter edition. The
                           relevance of the respective information for CMIF must be evaluated regarding its
                           necessity and usefulness in cross-project research or analysis. This is not
                           always a clear-cut decision. Of course, any information can increase the
                           research and analysis benefit of the data. However, previous experience has
                           shown that a cross-project metadata format is more accepted and used if only
                           absolutely necessary information has to be provided. On the other hand, the
                           effort for the project to provide its own metadata is the greater, the more
                           information has to be provided. An information-saturated, but complex metadata
                           format may seem ideal, but will find far less usage, which in turn greatly
                           diminishes its usefulness. Consequently, for pragmatic reasons, the format
                           should be kept manageable and simple.</p>

                                 such). The correspSearch web service already provides examples for this
                                 from the currently aggregated CMIF files, but these are not yet
                                 recognizable as such. The information is also important for the analysis
                                 of metadata from CMIF files, to prevent letters from being redundantly

                                 This is relevant as <i>automated</i> differentiation or

                                 sufficient for identification, but there are also numerous cases in

                                 as historical network research, it should be possible for this

                                 derived from the letter itself, but was taken from other sources or
                                 originates the researcher’s conclusion. Primarily this concerns the
                                 "header data" of a letter, such as sender and recipient, place of
                                 writing and receipt as well as the corresponding date information. Here
                                 it has always been common practice to place the respective data in the
                                 letterhead in square brackets to indicate that this information was
                                 "deduced" and could not be obtained from the original source itself.</p>

                                 from the investigations of the editor, can appear to have less or more
                                 certainty. For example, if the editor is not sure about a particular
                                 information, it is not only marked with square brackets, but also with a
                                 question mark. This makes it possible to offer the reader a suggestion
                                 without specifying it is definitely correct. This practice of marking
                                 uncertain assumptions is not only used for the header data of a letter,
                                 but also in the body of the letter, if mentioned persons or places
                                 cannot be identified unambiguously.</p>
                              
                              <p id="25"><span class="paragraph-number">25</span>In addition to these two practices to label uncertainty, there is
                                 another one that concerns the letter as a whole: the copy text (textual
                                 basis). In general, a letter should be edited on the original
                                 manuscript. In case the original is lost, this is obviously not
                                 possible. For this reason, the textual basis is always specified in
                                 letter editions. Besides the original handwriting, this can be a copy by
                                 the author (or their scribe), a copy by the recipient, a concept, a
                                 draft or a later print. In any case, the existing textual basis
                                 implicitly indicates the certainty by which it can be assumed that the
                                 letter has reached its intended recipient and with what content.</p>

                                 Information about the form in which a letter is ‘recorded’ is less
                                 relevant for scholarly questions that can be answered using metadata,
                                 however,it would support research in a meaningful way by enabling the
                                 user to see whatto expect at the end - whether it is printed or
                                 available online. This information would be particularly useful for
                                 scholars who want to build a corpus. In addition, it can easily happen

                        <p id="28"><span class="paragraph-number">28</span>Yet, it has to be answered how the desired information can be accommodated
                           considering the background of the basic encoding (see above) and in a
                           TEI-compliant way. If one wants to stick with the chosen approach and place all
                           information in the element correspDesc, only the attributes in correspDesc and
                           the child element correspDesc/note remain. The other two child elements
                           correspAction and correspContext are semantically and uniquely assigned to the
                           communication process so that they cannot be used as carriers for the additional
                           information, as described above.</p>
                        
                        <p id="29"><span class="paragraph-number">29</span>In addition to the attributes, the element note, containing an
                           "annotation" according to the TEI definition, remains in place. Although the
                           information to be coded might not be covered by the proper meaning of
                           “annotation” , the broader field of meanings attributed to “annotation” in the
                           academic field is indeed much larger. Note can thus also be understood as an
                           annotation of the correspondence description (correspDesc), which includes the
                           information mentioned above.</p>
                        
                        <p id="30"><span class="paragraph-number">30</span>Once note has been chosen as a container, the question remains to what
                           extent the listed information can be accommodated. Especially with regard to the
                           mentioned entities it seems obvious to use the relevant TEI elements, such as
                           persName. A coding would then look like this:</p>

                        <p id="31"><span class="paragraph-number">31</span>With this encoding, however, the question quickly arises as to whether one
                           should go along in a more general way with rs (referencing string), which is
                           specified via a @type attribute. An example based on a person would look like
                           this:</p>

                        <p id="32"><span class="paragraph-number">32</span>One advantage of this type of encoding would be a better flexibility when
                           using different entity types. These will become more differentiated in the
                           future and new ones will be added. For example, objects mentioned in letters
                           that have actually been handed down in museums and collections are
                           conceivable.</p>
                        
                        <p id="33"><span class="paragraph-number">33</span>Based on this generic approach, the working group came up with the idea of
                           whether it would be possible to encode the references based on the triple
                           notation of the Semantic Web. The references are noted as simple statements
                           according to the pattern "subject - predicate - object". A natural linguistic
                           analogy of a triple would be: "Letter XY mentions Johann Wolfgang von Goethe".
                           For the purpose of machine-readable identification, corresponding URIs are used
                           for subject and object, which are best defined across projects, e.g. in the
                           common standards file. The predicate is also defined as a machine-readable URI.
                           Eventually, this vocabulary would be part of CMIF v2. To encode such triples
                           with TEI elements, the element relation is provided in the TEI guidelines. The
                           example could then look like this:</p>

                              &lt;relation&gt;</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <p id="34"><span class="paragraph-number">34</span>The example 3 shows an accurate and convincing encoding in terms of
                           content. An advantage would also be that not only the mentioned entities, but
                           also other desired information could be coded, such as the URI of the archival
                           letter manuscript. </p>
                        
                        <p id="35"><span class="paragraph-number">35</span>In the beginning, various attributes in the element correspDesc were
                           discussed, but it became clear that it would be difficult to find suitable ones
                           for archival information etc. To give an example, the @corresp attribute could
                           be used for the archive URI. The definition would allow this without further
                           ado, but it is also ambiguous for it does not make a clear statement about the
                           content. Beyond that it is desired to accommodate not only the URI of the
                           archival document, but also URIs of other editions of the letter. All URIs could
                           be noted in @corresp, but they could only be distinguished by their own names,
                           e.g. by calling them or registering them in a processing web service, such as
                           correspSearch. As a result, this would mean that this information would no
                           longer be contained in CMIF itself.</p>
                        
                        <p id="36"><span class="paragraph-number">36</span>The proposed encoding with relations would therefore have the great
                           advantage of accommodating all desired information specifically. However, it
                           also has one disadvantage: this encoding is much more complicate than the other
                           encoding approaches. CMIF should be as simple as possible - both in terms of the
                           information to be included as well as the sort of encoding. Even so, could this
                           not be solved more easily? If one were to encode all the desired information as
                           in example 3, it would become apparent that the @active attribute always has the
                           same URI - namely that of the edited letter. But this is already clearly defined
                           by the element correspDesc as a whole and its attribute @ref. One idea would be
                           to use the TEI element ref instead of relation:</p>

                           redundant "subject", i.e. the edited letter in the form of a URI, would be
                           omitted. The CMIF would remain clear and easy for people to understand.</p>

                        <p id="39"><span class="paragraph-number">39</span>As in CMIF v1, URIs must be used for the targets (in ref/@target) in order
                           to ensure machine-readable identification of persons, locations, etc. This
                           assumes that there are suitable URIs for persons, places, etc. at all, which, if
                           possible, originate from an authority file. This is certainly problematic as
                           being discussed in the article on authority files. However, there are also
                           numerous cases in which entities do not have to be defined across projects. In
                           these cases, edition-internal URIs that identify or address corresponding
                           entities are also conceivable, even if little is known about the entity.
                           However, web services, which process CMIF files (e.g. correspSearch), have to
                           retrieve data (names, life dates etc.) in a standardized way via the URI. This
                           is currently neither customary nor sufficiently defined, so that further
                           development is necessary. Nevertheless, CMIF v2 should already provide this
                           option.</p>

                           required that converts technical terms of scholarly editions of correspondence

                           restrictive format. The CMI format provides only the most relevant information
                           for research and analysis in order to maintain and further promote broad
                           acceptance and usage in the community. In this context, attention is also paid

                           correspDesc/note/ref, uses Semantic Web concepts such as a simplified but
                           basically TEI-compliant triple notation, the use of URIs, and a controlled
                           vocabulary in the CMIF namespace. This will allow to capture other important
                           metadata - such as archival identifiers, uncertainties, and letter content - in
                           a highly operationalized form and to provide it in a lightweight interchange
